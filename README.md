# NumFuzz

Here are the tools and benchmarks of the APSEC2022 paper "NumFuzz: A Floating-Point Format Aware Fuzzer for Numerical Programs".


1) All experiments were done on an "Ubuntu20" machine. This project has already contained the corresponding llvm+clang (with LLVM version 6.0.1).
	
 	cd NumFuzz
	


2) Under the "tool" directory, install NumFuzz by:
	
 	sudo sh install_NumFuzz.sh

   install covFPFUZZ by:
   
	sudo sh install_covFPFUZZ.sh

   Other tool are similar.
 
4) Under the "test" directory, run test of NumFuzz by:
   
	sh run_test4_NumFuzz.sh

   Other tools are similar.
